# GameOfLife
Web version of Conway's Game of life

# How to run the project ðŸš€?
A web version is availible and playable [here](https://paulerny.github.io/GameOfLife/) but if you still want to have it running localy, follow these steps :

### 1 - Get the code !
That first step is pretty strait forward ðŸ˜‰
> `git clone git@github.com:PaulErny/GameOfLife.git`

### 2 - Install Dart
Make sure that the Dart programming language is installed on your device
> `dart --version`

If Dart isnt installed on your machine, refer to [the insallation guide](https://dart.dev/tutorials/web/get-started#2-install-dart) for further infos.
You may proceed to **step 3** once Dart and the CLI tools are installed

### 3 - Have some fun ðŸŽ®

Navigate to the location of the repository
> `cd PATH-TO-THE-REPO/GameOfLife/GameOfLife-front`

Then run the project
> `webdev serve`

Once the server has started, navigate to [localhost:8080](http://localhost:8080) and have fun !
